"""Drift check for upstream constants this client mirrors by hand.

Some upstream values are never served over the API, so the client hardcodes a copy.
These copies fail SILENTLY -- when upstream edits one, nothing here breaks, decodes
wrong, or logs; the app just goes on making a slightly worse decision. What is mirrored,
and what breaks when each goes stale, is in scripts/mirrors.json. Adding a mirror to the
codebase means adding it there in the same PR.

This diffs each watched upstream region between two revisions of the `upstream/`
submodule and names the Kotlin file that has to be reconciled. It answers "did this move",
not "are the two sides equal" -- deliberately. Upstream's tables reference enum symbols
rather than literals, mix regexes with strings, and in at least one case carry meaning in
a COMMENTED-OUT line, so comparing values needs a TypeScript interpreter and would still
miss things.

Run it during a /sync-upstream pass, which is the only time these can drift: the
constants change when upstream moves, and upstream only moves at a sync.

    scripts/check-mirrors.py                       # synced commit -> submodule HEAD
    scripts/check-mirrors.py --to v0.8.8           # synced commit -> a target tag
    scripts/check-mirrors.py --from v0.8.6 --to v0.8.7
    scripts/check-mirrors.py --diff                # show what actually changed
    scripts/check-mirrors.py --list                # print the registry, check nothing
    scripts/check-mirrors.py --self-test           # check the extractor, needs no submodule

Exit status is 0 only when every watched region is byte-identical across the two
revisions. Any change, and any region that could not be located, exits 1 -- a missing
anchor means upstream renamed or removed the symbol, which is the loudest signal there
is, not a reason to skip.
