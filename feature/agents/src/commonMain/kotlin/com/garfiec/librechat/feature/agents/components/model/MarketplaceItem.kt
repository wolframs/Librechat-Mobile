 * across a list that mixes capabilities, plugin tools, MCP servers and skills.
 *
 * Upstream's fifth kind, `action`, is deliberately absent: actions are defined per agent rather
 * than picked from a shared catalog, they are not favouritable server-side, and mobile already
 * edits them in their own panel.
