/**
 * Renders markdown via the m3 [Markdown] composable, backed by the session-wide
 * [LocalParsedMarkdownCache] of parsed ASTs.
 *
 * Two paths, chosen by [streaming]:
 *
 * **Settled content** ([streaming] = false — finished messages, inline
 * artifacts). The content is stable, so a valid cache hit is rendered directly
 * via `Markdown(state = cached)` — no [com.mikepenz.markdown.model.MarkdownState]
 * is built and no parse runs (not even the synchronous `parseBlocking` that
 * [immediate] would trigger). This is the LazyColumn re-entry path: scrolling a
 * message off-screen and back renders instantly from the cache with zero CPU.
 * Because the content won't change underneath us there is no branch-swap flash.
 * On a cache miss (first display, or after LRU eviction) it falls through to the
 * live path below and caches the result.
 *
 * **Streaming content** ([streaming] = true — the live reply bubble). Content
 * changes every delta, so a cache-hit fast path would thrash: an earlier version
 * branched between `Markdown(state = cached)` and a freshly-remembered live
 * state, and the post-parse cache write flipped the branch every token, each
 * flip re-creating a [com.mikepenz.markdown.model.MarkdownState] that started at
 * [State.Loading] (a 0-px slot) — a visible flash per delta. Instead we keep a
 * single persistent state with `retainState = true`, so a content change does
 * NOT reset the flow to Loading; the previous [State.Success] stays on screen
 * until the next parse lands and the text never blanks between tokens. Streaming
 * also does NOT write to the cache: a long reply would otherwise stuff hundreds
 * of partial-content entries into the shared LRU and evict other messages'
 * settled ASTs. The terminal content is cached once the reply renders as settled.
 *
 * Parsed state is independent of presentation, so the chat-wide paragraph spacing
 * can recompose all three rendering paths without invalidating the AST cache.
 *
 * [immediate] parses the *initial* content synchronously (no Loading frame on
 * first paint) — used for fully-settled artifact content. It only affects the
 * live path's first parse; it is not involved in the streaming flash fix, which
 * relies on the persistent-state + `retainState` behavior.
 *
 * [trailingCursor] renders the live streaming cursor at the end of this content —
 * see StreamingCursor.kt. It rewrites the content being parsed, so it also opts out
 * of the AST cache on both sides: a sentinel-bearing AST must never be served to a
 * settled render, and a per-delta write would evict other messages' ASTs.
