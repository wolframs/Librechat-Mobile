/**
 * Turns a message's flat content-part list into the shape the bubble renders: segments split at
 * mid-run steers, each holding activity groups and standalone parts.
 *
 * ONE transform for both concerns on purpose. Activity grouping and steer segmentation both carve
 * up the same list, and two passes would eventually disagree about a boundary — a group spanning a
 * steer would render the user's words inside a collapsed tool block. Pure and memoizable so the
 * boundaries can be asserted directly; this module has no Compose test harness, so a function is
 * the only testable form.
 *
 * Mirrors upstream `client/src/utils/groupToolCalls.ts` (grouping) and the `postSteerAuthors` pass
 * in `ContentParts.tsx` (segmentation).
 *
 * @param groupActivity false for a comparison pane's lane, which renders every part standalone —
 *  see [hasParallelGroupIds]. Steer segmentation still applies either way.
