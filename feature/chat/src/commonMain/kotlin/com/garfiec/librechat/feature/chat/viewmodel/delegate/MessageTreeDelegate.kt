 * sibling is displayed per parent and where the in-flight reply attaches in the
 * display path. Also owns the temporary-chat toggle and the in-memory finalize
 * ([finalizeChatDisplay]) that drives the gap-free completion view.
 *
 * Pure state transforms over [MessageTreeHandle] — no repositories, no coroutines.
 * The streaming-anchor invariant lives here (see [anchorStreamTo]); the send/edit
