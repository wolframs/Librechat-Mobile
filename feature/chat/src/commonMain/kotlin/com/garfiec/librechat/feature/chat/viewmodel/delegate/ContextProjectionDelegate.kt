/**
 * Owns the context-usage gauge's projection path. Watches the viewed branch tail + model/endpoint
 * and asks the server to project the next call's context window so the gauge can show on a loaded
 * or snapshot-less branch (v0.8.7). Read-only over chat state — it only sets
 * [ChatUiState.contextUsage]; it never touches messages/branches/Room, so it can't disturb the
 * streaming-anchor invariant. The live `on_context_usage` SSE event owns the gauge during a stream,
 * so [refreshContextProjection] no-ops while [ChatUiState.isStreaming].
 *
 * On the 0.8.8 line the server-side projection endpoint was removed (#13953); the projection call
 * short-circuits to `null` there (gate lives in `EndpointTokenRepositoryImpl`), so on those servers
 * this delegate becomes a no-op writer and the gauge is driven solely by the `on_context_usage` SSE.
