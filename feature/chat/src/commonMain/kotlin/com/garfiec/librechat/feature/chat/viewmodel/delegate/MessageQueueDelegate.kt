/**

 * streaming. Holds only the list + pause flag in its [QueueHandle]; the actual send is
 * delegated back to `ChatViewModel` via [sendWithSpec] so all the request-build / optimistic-
 * insert / lineage logic stays in one place.
 *
 * Draining is driven by the stream lifecycle: a successful `Final` calls [drainNext]; a Stop
 * or stream-error calls [pause] so nothing auto-fires until the user taps "Send queued"
 * ([resume]). [onQueueChanged] lets the owner persist a recoverable snapshot after each completed
 * mutation. A restored queue is deliberately paused by `ChatViewModel` until the user resumes it.

     * whenever an item with uploaded attachments joins the queue, and returns as soon as a tick
     * finds no file ids left — or finds the route ruled out — a later add starts a fresh loop. Upstream heartbeats "while anything is queued" for the
     * same reason, and it keeps an idle chat from parking a coroutine that can never have work.
     *
     * **The loop delays first and renews second, deliberately.** Renewing at the top would fire
     * an unspaced request on every cold start, and a kill/relaunch cycle would turn that into a
     * burst against a route that now meters per user (`FILE_USAGE_USER_MAX` 120 / 15 min) and
     * logs a scored `FILE_UPLOAD_LIMIT` violation on a breach. Delaying first means a fresh
     * process is silent for a full interval, and the first tick is the earliest possible request.
     *
     * **Explicitly a no-op once this ViewModel or the process is gone.** The loop runs on the
     * ViewModel's scope and the queue is never persisted, so when either dies there is nothing
     * left to protect — the same reasoning upstream applies to an abandoned browser tab. Note
     * the platforms differ in how soon that happens: iOS suspends a backgrounded app quickly,
     * while Android only freezes cached processes from API 34+ and this app is `minSdk 26`, so
     * on Android 8–13 a backgrounded process keeps ticking. That is the direction that costs
     * nothing (a live queue keeps being protected), so it needs no extra handling.
     *
     * Idempotent — a second call while the loop is live is ignored.
