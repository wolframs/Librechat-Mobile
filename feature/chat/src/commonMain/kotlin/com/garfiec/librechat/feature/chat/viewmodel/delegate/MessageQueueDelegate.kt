/**
 * Owns the in-memory FIFO queue of follow-up messages the user staged while a reply was
 * streaming. Holds only the list + pause flag in its [QueueHandle]; the actual send is
 * delegated back to `ChatViewModel` via [sendWithSpec] so all the request-build / optimistic-
 * insert / lineage logic stays in one place.
 *
 * Draining is driven by the stream lifecycle: a successful `Final` calls [drainNext]; a Stop
 * or stream-error calls [pause] so nothing auto-fires until the user taps "Send queued"
 * ([resume]). [onQueueChanged] lets the owner persist a recoverable snapshot after each completed
 * mutation. A restored queue is deliberately paused by `ChatViewModel` until the user resumes it.
