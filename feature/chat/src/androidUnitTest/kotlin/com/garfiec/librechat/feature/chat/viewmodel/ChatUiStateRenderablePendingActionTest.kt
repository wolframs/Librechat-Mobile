/**
 * Tests for [ChatUiState.renderablePendingAction].
 *
 * The load-bearing property is that it does NOT consult any backend-version gate: a pause is
 * self-proving (only a HITL-capable server can announce one), and a version/date gate would fail
 * closed on servers built past the pinned upstream commit — the exact servers that pause. A hidden
 * card there strands the user on a stream that stays `isStreaming` forever. See VERSION_GATES.md.
 *
 * Pure-function tests — no ViewModel instantiation.
