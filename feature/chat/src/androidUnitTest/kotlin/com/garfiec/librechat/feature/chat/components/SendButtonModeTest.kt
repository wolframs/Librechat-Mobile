/**
 * The composer button must NAME what tapping it does.
 *
 * This is the half of the during-run send that no behavioural test reaches: routing is decided by
 * [com.garfiec.librechat.feature.chat.viewmodel.ChatUiState.duringRunSendTarget] and exercised in
 * `ChatViewModelDuringRunSendTest`, while the button's face is derived separately — and for a
 * while, from a different source (the user's steer/queue preference), so a live
 * `ask_user_question` pause got a button reading "add to queue" over a tap that answered the
 * question. Nothing failed, because nothing compared the two.
