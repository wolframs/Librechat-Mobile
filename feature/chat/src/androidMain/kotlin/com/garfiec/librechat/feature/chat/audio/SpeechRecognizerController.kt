/**
 * Drives an in-process [SpeechRecognizer] for continuous live dictation with partial results.
 * Owns the single-shot→continuous restart loop, the on-device vs network recognizer choice with
 * fallback, and error recovery.
 *
 * All methods and callbacks run on the main thread — [SpeechRecognizer] requires a Looper and its
 * `destroy()` must be called on the thread that created it. The owner ([VoiceInputDelegate]) drives
 * this from the (main-dispatched) ViewModel scope.
 *
 * Continuous behavior: [SpeechRecognizer] is single-shot per `startListening`, so on each final
 * segment (or a recoverable no-speech error) the recognizer restarts until [stop]/[cancel]. A cap on
 * consecutive empty restarts prevents indefinite silence from spinning it forever.
