/**
 * The streaming follower must stand down while a run is paused for human review.
 *
 * A pause does not end the run: `isStreaming` stays true across it, so the per-frame follower in
 * [MessageList] keeps pinning the list's tail to the bottom while the output it exists to follow
 * has stopped. That matters because the pause card is the thing that grows underneath — a long
 * question laying out, options expanding, an answer field taking a second line — and every one of
 * those pushes the tail down. A live follower chases it, so the top of the card (the question
 * itself) walks off screen while the user is reading it.
 *
 * Both tests apply the same stimulus — the last item grows — and differ only in whether a pause is
 * outstanding, so the control proves the measurement can actually detect chasing. Position is read
 * from the anchor's own bounds rather than from `LazyListState`, which [MessageList] owns
 * internally and does not expose; the anchor stays composed either way because a LazyColumn item
 * composes whole while any part of it is on screen.
