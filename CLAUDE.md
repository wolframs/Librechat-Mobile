# Switchboard

Native mobile client for LibreChat (Android & iOS). Connects to existing LibreChat backend servers (no backend changes). Users specify server URL during onboarding.

## Deployed backend compatibility

Read `docs/SURPLUS_MCP_UPSTREAM_SYNC.md` for the September 2026 Surplus/MCP audit,
provider/TTL contracts, cost-dashboard behavior, and the fork-specific Room v10
migration. The Mac backend is an independent working tree; mobile work does not
imply deployment there.

## Active UX Work

Read `UX_GAP_WORKLOG.md` before starting UX-gap implementation. It is the persistent
status, evidence, acceptance-test, and session ledger for the current reliability and
polish backlog. Update it whenever an item changes state.

## Tech Stack

- **UI**: Jetpack Compose + Navigation Compose 3 (Nav 3)
- **DI**: Koin (KMP-ready)
- **Network**: Ktor Client (OkHttp engine)
- **Serialization**: Kotlinx Serialization
- **Local Storage**: Room (cache), DataStore (prefs), EncryptedSharedPreferences (tokens)
- **Build**: Gradle 9.5.1, AGP 9.2.1, Kotlin 2.4.10, compileSdk 36, minSdk 26

## Module Layout

```
app/                  → Single Activity, adaptive navigation (phone/tablet)
shared/               → KMP shared framework (iOS entry point, shared navigation)
build-logic/          → 13 convention plugins for consistent Gradle config
core/common/          → Result type, dispatcher DI, coroutine scopes, extensions
core/model/           → @Serializable data classes (pure Kotlin, no Android deps)
core/network/         → Ktor client, 16 API services, SSE client, auth interceptor
core/data/            → Room DB, DataStore, EncryptedSharedPrefs, repository impls
core/ui/              → Material 3 theme, shared composables
feature/auth/         → Server URL, Login, Register, 2FA, OAuth, Forgot Password
feature/chat/         → Real-time chat with SSE streaming, message rendering
feature/conversations/→ Paginated list, CRUD, tags, search, export/import
feature/settings/     → Account, appearance, about, danger zone
feature/agents/       → Agent marketplace with search and categories
feature/files/        → File upload, management, image viewer
```

Each module has its own `CLAUDE.md` with specific guidance.

## Architecture Rules

- Feature modules depend on `:core:*` only, never on each other
- Single Activity with Nav 3 (`NavDisplay` + `NavBackStack<NavKey>` + `entryProvider`)
- Unidirectional data flow: UI → ViewModel → Repository → API/Room
- Room is a read-through cache; server is source of truth
- Custom SSE parser over raw ByteReadChannel (not Ktor SSE plugin)

## Adding a New Feature Module

1. Create the module directory under `feature/`
2. Apply the convention plugin in `build.gradle.kts` — this auto-applies Koin + Compose deps:
   - `librechat.kmp.feature` — for KMP modules with shared iOS + Android code (most features)
   - `librechat.mobile.feature` — for Android-only modules
3. Create `di/<Feature>Module.kt` with a Koin `module { }` containing `viewModelOf(::YourViewModel)` definitions
4. Add the module to `sharedKoinModules` (`shared/src/commonMain/.../di/SharedKoinModules.kt`) — the single list both Android (`LibreChatApplication`) and iOS (`IosSharedModule`) start from, so a module registered once is wired on both platforms
5. Use `koinViewModel()` in screen composables to inject ViewModels

## Backend Quirks

- Mutation endpoints wrap body in `arg` field: `{ "arg": { ... } }`
- Two-phase SSE: POST → `{ streamId }`, then GET stream. `streamId === conversationId`
- `GET /api/config` drives feature availability — never hardcode
- ua-parser-js middleware rejects non-browser User-Agents with 403 (workaround: Chrome UA string)
- Refresh token sent via request body (not HTTP-only cookies)
- iOS SSE streaming uses a custom `NWConnection`-based HTTP/1.1 transport (`core/network/src/iosMain/.../sse/SseHttpTransport.ios.kt`) to bypass NSURLSession's undocumented `text/*` content-type buffering. See `core/network/CLAUDE.md` SSE section for the two-layer buffering story.

## Upstream Sync

- **`upstream/`** — Git submodule of the [official LibreChat repo](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat). Read-only reference for API and web app parity. Do not modify.
- **`UPSTREAM_VERSION`** — Tracks which official tag/commit this mobile build is based on. Updated by the `/sync-upstream` skill.
- **`backendTargetVersion`** (root `version.properties`) — single source of truth for the targeted backend; must match the tag in `UPSTREAM_VERSION` (without `v` prefix). A core/common Gradle task code-generates `BackendVersion.SUPPORTED_BACKEND_VERSION` from it, and `release.yml` reads it for release notes. Edit the property, not the constant.
- **`/sync-upstream`** — Claude Code skill to diff upstream releases, identify gaps, propose changes, and implement them with user approval. Uses Agent Teams (investigator, android-expert, implementer, verifier).
- **`scripts/web-assets.json`** — registry of the third-party JavaScript the artifact/diagram/math
  WebViews execute (KaTeX, mermaid, marked, highlight.js, Tailwind, Babel, React). All of it is
  **vendored into the app**; none of it is fetched at render time. This is required for F-Droid,
  which rejects apps that download executable code without explicit opt-in consent — a
  `<script src="https://cdn…">` in a WebView is exactly that. It also closes a silent-drift hole:
  an unversioned CDN URL served whatever the CDN resolved that day, and two libraries had already
  broken that way without failing a build or a test. `scripts/vendor-web-assets.py` downloads the
  pins and CI verifies the tree against a sha256 lock. **Repin via `/update-web-assets`**, never by
  editing a vendored file. Adding a new WebView dependency means adding a registry entry in the
  same PR. See `feature/chat/CLAUDE.md` for how a page resolves them per platform.

- **`scripts/mirrors.json`** — registry of upstream constants the client copies by hand, because the server never serves them (which providers take documents natively, which MIME types the parser extracts, which feedback reasons the write route accepts). These drift **silently**: nothing fails to decode and nothing errors, so a sync's ordinary diff sweep reads them as inert constant edits. `scripts/check-mirrors.py` diffs each watched region between two upstream revisions and names the Kotlin file to reconcile; `/sync-upstream` runs it at Phase 0. **Adding a hardcoded mirror means adding a registry entry in the same PR** — a mirror nobody registered is one nobody will notice going stale.
