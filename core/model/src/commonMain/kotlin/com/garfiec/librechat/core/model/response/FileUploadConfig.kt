 * client's `getEndpointFileConfig`: the per-endpoint entry wins, falling back to the special
 * `"default"` endpoint entry. The server reports these limits in bytes (`mbToBytes`).
 *
 * Resolution order matters: the served `/api/files/config` object carries the per-file limits
 * **only** under `endpoints.<name>.fileSizeLimit` (with an `endpoints["default"]` catch-all) — its
 * top-level `fileSizeLimit` is never populated by the stock backend (that level exposes
 * `serverFileSizeLimit`, a separate server-wide cap we don't model). So an endpoint not explicitly
 * listed (openAI, google, bedrock, custom, …) resolves through the `"default"` entry, not the
 * always-null top-level field. The top-level [fileSizeLimit] is kept only as a last-ditch fallback
 * for a non-standard backend that happens to send it.
 *
 * Returns null when no limit is configured (older backend, or no default entry) so callers can
 * fail open. A limit of 0 — the server's marker for a disabled endpoint — is returned as-is;
 * enforcement callers should treat non-positive limits as "no check" since disabled uploads are
 * gated elsewhere.
