/**
 * The typed `type` values the backend puts on a stream-error payload — upstream's `ErrorTypes`
 * (`packages/data-provider/src/config.ts`).
 *
 * The server used to swallow several of these and let the run continue on stale state; it now
 * raises them as typed errors and propagates them. Without a mapping a client renders the raw
 * JSON payload as the error text, which is how `{"type":"resource_recovery_required", …}` ends up
 * on screen where a sentence telling the user to reattach their files belongs.
 *
 * Only the codes with something ACTIONABLE to say are listed. That is the point of the type: an
 * unrecognized code must fall through to the generic message rather than being surfaced raw, so
 * adding a case is how a code stops being generic — never a requirement for one to be safe.
 *
 * The user-provided-key codes deliberately are NOT here. They already route through
 * [parseUserKeyError] to a snackbar with a Settings action, and duplicating them would surface the
 * same failure twice.
