/**
 * Body of `POST /api/agents/chat/resume` — resolves a run paused for human review.
 *
 * The agent-selection fields are NOT decoration. The resume route re-runs the same
 * `buildEndpointOption` middleware a normal send goes through, and then compares the request
 * against the pause's pinned fingerprint (endpoint, endpointType, agent_id, model, spec,
 * promptPrefix, ephemeralAgent). A mismatch is rejected 403 "Cannot resume with a different
 * agent configuration", so these must be the SAME values the paused turn was sent with, not
 * whatever the picker shows now.
 *
 * Exactly one decision channel is populated, selected by the pause's payload type:
 * [decisions] for `tool_approval` (one entry per paused `tool_call_id` — a partial batch is
 * 400), and for `ask_user_question` either [answers] or [answer] depending on whether the
 * payload carried a `questions` array. The server picks the branch off the PAYLOAD, not off
 * which field the request populated, so the choice is not the client's to make.
 *
 * The reply is only an ack ([com.garfiec.librechat.core.model.response.ChatResumeResponse]);
 * the continuation streams over the SSE connection already open for this conversation.
