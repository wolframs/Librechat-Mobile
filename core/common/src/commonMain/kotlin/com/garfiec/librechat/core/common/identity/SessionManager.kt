/**
 * App-singleton **sole owner** of account-[Session] transitions. It is the only collector of [ActiveAccountProvider.state] and the
 * only mutator of [current]; every transition runs under [mutex] so `cancelAndJoin(old) → publish(new)`
 * is atomic and a fast re-login can't form B's session before A's has fully torn down.
 *
 * The session forms **only** on `Resolved(id != null)` — the non-null gate: both [Warming]
 * (boot sentinel) and `Resolved(null)` (logged-out) map to "no session". So a session can never form
 * under an unknown or logged-out identity, and a flip to either tears the current one down.
 *
 * **Single teardown owner:** the imperative logout path drives [endCurrentSession] (so it can
 * sequence the DELETEs after the join) while this reactive collector handles non-logout flips. The
 * collector also reacts to logout's subsequent flip-to-null, but that reconciles to "no session" as a
 * no-op, so the two paths don't double-tear-down; logout must route through [endCurrentSession] rather
 * than running its own parallel teardown.
