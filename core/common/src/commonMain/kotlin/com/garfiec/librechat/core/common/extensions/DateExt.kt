 * mapping N conversations resolve it once. Every formatter defaults to [current], so one-off call

 * Computing it during a ViewModel mapping freezes it into immutable state until unrelated data
 * changes; computing it inside `remember(row.updatedAt)` freezes it just as hard, because `remember`
 * exists precisely not to recompute across recompositions and `updatedAt` does not change as time
 * passes. Either way the label rots.

 * To get a label that actually advances, the caller must supply a [reference] that changes — see
 * `ProvideRelativeTimeReference` / `LocalRelativeTimeReference` in feature/conversations, which
 * tick one and thereby invalidate exactly the composables reading it.
