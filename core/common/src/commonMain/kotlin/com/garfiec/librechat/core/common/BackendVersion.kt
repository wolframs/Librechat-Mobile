     * [featureSupport] instead wherever those two deserve different handling (see its docs).
     *

     * next-release features still REPORTS the previous release version (e.g. a 0.8.8-cycle
     * dev build reports "0.8.7") — [isCompatibleOrNewer] alone would hide the feature. This
     * helper first applies the version gate, then falls back to the build commit's DATE for
     * DEV-classified servers: if the server's build commit is at or after the day the feature
     * landed upstream, the feature is present. Dates are ISO `yyyy-MM-dd` in UTC — derive
     * landedDate with `TZ=UTC git log -1 --date=format-local:%Y-%m-%d --format=%cd <commit>`,
     * matching how the commit map bakes dates — and compare lexicographically. Upstream
     * squash-merges stamp commit times at merge, so in a single timezone the dates are
     * monotonic (verified over the map window; per-committer-timezone `%cs` dates are NOT
     * monotonic and must not be used for landedDate).
     *
     * GRANULARITY CAVEAT: the comparison is by DAY, so every commit sharing the landing commit's
     * date satisfies the gate — including the ones that merged hours BEFORE it. Upstream lands a
     * dozen-plus commits a day, so this is routine, not a corner case. Pick landedDate for the
     * direction whose misclassification is harmless: use the landing day when a same-day
     * predecessor being treated as "has the feature" is tolerable, and the day AFTER when it is
     * not (then same-day successors are treated as "lacks the feature" instead). A landedDate that
     * needs neither error is not expressible without a per-commit ordinal in the commit map.
     *
     * Coverage window: the commit map knows tags plus dev commits only UP TO the app's pinned
     * upstream commit. A server built from a LATER commit resolves to no version at all
     * (null [detected]), so this helper fails closed — a server tracking upstream `latest`
     * drifts past the pin within days of a sync, hiding date-gated features again until the
     * next sync/regeneration. Accepted fail-safe tradeoff; documented in VERSION_GATES.md.
     *
     * Fail-closed on null [detected]: an unresolved server hides date-gated features, matching
     * the VERSION_GATES.md v0.8.7 precedent (surfacing an action that 404s is worse than
     * hiding it). Callsites wanting fail-open must handle null themselves before calling.

     * @param detected The resolved server identity, or null when detection failed.
     * @param minVersion First TAGGED version carrying the feature (e.g. "0.8.8-rc1" — use the
     *        upcoming rc line even before the tag exists).
     * @param landedDate ISO date the feature's upstream commit landed (e.g. "2026-07-14"), or

     * Deliberately NOT inferred: that a DEV build reporting a version far below [minVersion]
     * (say 0.8.5 against a 0.8.8-rc1 gate) must be ABSENT because a dev build can only
     * under-report by one release line. It is true of upstream's current release habit and
     * nothing enforces it — one 0.8.8 → 0.9.0 bump turns the inference into a silent
     * feature-suppression, which is the exact failure this three-state split exists to end. The
