/**
 * The one 401-recovery path shared by every transport (Ktor [AuthInterceptorPlugin] and the iOS raw
 * SSE transport): refresh the account the request was snapshotted for — keyed and URL-pinned to the
 * snapshot, so a switch that raced the request refreshes the right account against the right server,
 * never the live one. Without a snapshot (refresh client / tests) falls back to the live active
 * account, preserving legacy behavior.
 *
 * Maps the refresh [RefreshResult] to a [BearerResult]: only a genuine [RefreshResult.HardExpired]
 * (or a refreshed-but-empty slot, meaning a logout/removal raced the refresh) becomes [Expired] and
 * logs the user out; a [RefreshResult.Transient] becomes [Transient] and keeps the session.
 *
 * The snapshot's bearer is handed to the refresh as `usedAccessToken`: it is exactly what this request
 * put on the wire (the attach phase reads the snapshot, never the live cache), so a cold-start fan-out
 * of N 401s collapses to one refresh POST — every waiter behind the flight lock sees the rotated token
 * and skips its own.
