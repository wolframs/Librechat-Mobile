/**

 * [RequestIdentityKey]; every URL / bearer / host read downstream reads *this* instead of the live
 * providers, so an account switch that flips the providers mid-request can't tear the triple apart.
 *
 * [isPending] marks a snapshot minted from a [PendingRequestIdentity] (an add-account flow
 * authenticating against a server that is not yet active). A pending request has no keyed account to
 * refresh, and its failures belong to the add flow, not the app: the 401-retry passes it through
 * without refreshing anything or emitting the global session-expired signal.

 * of the live active account. Ktor's request pipeline executes in the caller's coroutine, so the
 * element reaches [SwitchGate.captureSnapshot] with no per-call plumbing — and because the *live*
 * providers are never touched, the active account's own traffic keeps flowing under its own identity
 * while another account authenticates.
 *
 * [bearer] is read per request (not captured once) because the staged token only exists after the
 * flow's sign-in call succeeds; earlier calls (config validation, the login POST itself) carry none.
 *
 * [headers] sits **before** [bearer] on purpose. Several call sites pass the bearer as a trailing
 * lambda; a new parameter appended after it would silently re-bind that lambda to the new slot and
 * compile clean while sending no token at all. It also has to resolve the warm-up itself:
 * [SwitchGate.captureSnapshot] short-circuits to this identity *before* any of its own awaits, so the
 * add-account probe would otherwise race the header store's first read — and losing the gateway
 * credential on the probe is exactly the failure this feature exists to fix.

/**
 * The account-switch barrier. Two jobs, both closing the torn-pair race that a naive switch opens:
 *
 * 1. **Atomic snapshot.** The HTTP pipeline reads the base URL at one phase and the bearer at a later
 *    one, from two independent providers under two different locks. A switch flipping them between the
 *    two reads would send a mismatched `(urlB, bearerA)` — same-server → A's data served as B;
 *    different-server → A's bearer transmitted to B's host (credential exposure). [captureSnapshot]
 *    reads all three under [lock] in one shot so a request holds one coherent identity.
 * 2. **Park-during-flip.** [withSwitch] closes [open] and mutates the providers under the same [lock],
 *    so a new request either snapshots fully *before* the flip (and completes against the old account —
 *    whose tokens are retained, so that's correct) or parks until the flip finishes and snapshots the
 *    new account. No request ever observes a half-applied switch.
 *
 * [lock] is held only for the snapshot reads / the flip mutation — never across network I/O — so
 * per-request contention is negligible. The coordinator ([AccountSwitcher]) is the sole caller of
 * [withSwitch]; the [SwitchBarrierPlugin] (and the iOS SSE transport) are the callers of
 * [captureSnapshot].
