# core:data

Room database, DataStore preferences, EncryptedSharedPreferences for tokens, and all repository implementations. This is the coordination layer between network and local storage.

## What This Module Provides

- **Room database** (`db/LibreChatDatabase.kt`): version 10 with exported schemas and automatic migrations.
- **Entities/DAOs**: server cache entities plus account-scoped drafts. Complex fields are stored as JSON through `Converters`; `DraftEntity.stateJson` is a nullable, feature-owned versioned payload stored atomically beside draft text.
- **DataStore**: `ServerDataStore` (server URL prefs), `SettingsDataStore` (user preferences).
- **Token storage** (`datastore/TokenDataStore.kt`): Implements `TokenManager` from `:core:network` using `EncryptedSharedPreferences` with AES-256. Uses `Mutex` to ensure only one refresh runs at a time when multiple 401s arrive concurrently.
- **Repositories** (`repository/`): Interface + Impl for each domain: `AuthRepository`, `ConversationRepository`, `MessageRepository`, `ChatRepository`, `FileRepository`, `AgentRepository`, `PresetRepository`, `PromptRepository`, `TagRepository`, `ShareRepository`, `ConfigRepository`, `UserRepository`, `SettingsRepository`.
- **Entity mappers** (`db/mapper/EntityMapper.kt`): Convert between Room entities and domain models.
- **Sync manager** (`sync/ConversationSyncManager.kt`): Orchestrates cache invalidation.

## Key Patterns

### Repository: Interface + Impl

```kotlin
interface ConversationRepository {
    fun observeConversations(...): Flow<Result<List<Conversation>>>
    suspend fun updateTitle(id: String, title: String): Result<Conversation>
}
```

All impls take constructor parameters (api, dao, mapper, dispatcher) wired via Koin named qualifiers.

### Read-Through Cache

1. Emit cached data from Room immediately (first page).
2. Fetch fresh data from network via API service.
3. Upsert into Room. The Room `Flow` auto-emits the updated list.
4. On network error, the cached data remains visible; error is surfaced separately.

### Recoverable draft state

`DraftRepository.saveDraftState` atomically stores text and an optional versioned feature payload in
one account-scoped Room row. `feature:chat` uses the payload for server-uploaded attachment references
and paused queued messages. Existing text-only rows migrate with `state_json = null`; repository
callers must treat an absent or unknown payload as an ordinary text-only draft.

### Account-keyed token store (`CommonTokenDataStore`)

Tokens are namespaced by account (`acct:<accountId>:access_token`) and several accounts' tokens are
retained at rest at once (multi-account, issue #179). Concurrency uses three cooperating pieces, not a
single refresh mutex:

- **Cold-start warm-up** — `AccountRegistry` calls `TokenManager.warmUp()` on its IO dispatcher before
  completing `AccountReadyGate`. Android creates `EncryptedSharedPreferences` lazily there, not during
  Koin construction on Main. First routing and all gated requests wait for the authoritative result;
  `isAuthenticated` is a cache-only check and must never initiate secure-storage IO.

- **`stateMutex`** — guards the in-memory identity + cached bearer and short storage reads/writes of
  it. Held only for brief critical sections, **never across the refresh network POST**, so a switch or
  logout never stalls behind a slow refresh.
- **per-account `flightMutex`/`flights`** — single-flights refreshes of the *same* account across their
  POST, so a second 401 reads the rotated token instead of re-POSTing a spent one.
- **`tokenEpoch`** — bumped by every op that invalidates token truth (logout, clear, removal, a new
  authentication, an identity re-home). A refresh captures it before its POST and discards its result
  if it changed, so a refresh racing a teardown can't resurrect a cleared session even with no lock
  held across the POST.

Interactive sign-in (`setTokens`) **stages** the pair under the bare keys and drops the active binding;
`onAccountResolved` re-homes it into the account's keyed slot. This makes a re-login while another
account is active unable to corrupt/leak into that account's slot.

Wrap `EncryptedSharedPreferences` access in try/catch -- some OEM devices have broken Keystore
implementations. `TokenDataStore` recovers in place rather than crashing: a single undecryptable entry
is dropped (other retained accounts stay logged in), a broken keyset is wiped and rebuilt with a fresh
master key, and if even a rebuild can't produce a working store it degrades to an in-memory session for
the process. Construction never throws into `startKoin`. The next request then 401s and routes to
re-login through the normal expired-session flow.

**The store is built lazily and the cache is warmed off the main thread** (#326 follow-up). `MasterKey.Builder().build()`
plus `EncryptedSharedPreferences.create` cost 300–900 ms on an emulator's software Keymaster, and the
eager `AccountRegistry` single used to pay that on the thread `startKoin` runs on. So the encrypted
store is created on first use behind a monitor, and `TokenCacheWarmer` (an eager single) calls
`warmTokenCache()` on the IO dispatcher. Its registration position relative to `AccountRegistry` only
sequences construction, not the launches, so it is not an invariant.

Three rules keep that safe, each with a test in `CommonTokenDataStoreWarmTest`:

- **The warmer performs the load; it never awaits one.** A logged-out cold start touches no other entry
  point on the store — `AccountRegistry` takes its `activeEntry == null` branch and never calls
  `selectAccount` — so a warm that waited for someone else's seed would never complete.
- **`warmTokenCache()` takes `stateMutex`, and is the only writer of the cache fields outside a
  mutation.** Every mutator holds that lock across its whole critical section, so a warm either
  completes before one starts or begins after it finished — and in the latter case it reads back what
  the mutation just wrote through to storage, since memory always mirrors disk. Note `tokenInitialized`
  is set *only* by the load, so a post-mutation warm still runs; it is the mutex, not that flag, that
  makes it harmless.
- **`ensureTokenLoaded()` is the synchronous fallback, and it reads through without publishing.**
  Populating the cache fields from there would be an unlocked read-read-write-write against the same
  fields a mutator writes under `stateMutex`: a caller that began reading before `setTokens` wrote and
  assigned after would replace the fresh bearer with the pre-login disk value *and* pin it by marking
  the cache initialized — every later request on a stale bearer until process death. Reading through
  costs a repeated decrypt in the startup window instead. Losing the race therefore costs a duplicated
  read, never a wrong bearer, which is what licenses the design and what keeps `isAuthenticated` on
  `TokenManager`.

Two consequences worth knowing. `emitSessionExpired` is not `suspend`, so it cannot warm the cache; it
suppresses a scoped emit only against a *seeded* identity, because an unseeded `activeAccountKey` is
null and would swallow the expiry signal. And the "a write before the warm must not land in
`memoryFallback`" trap has **no unit test** — Robolectric cannot build `EncryptedSharedPreferences`, so
every write there goes to memory and a test would pass for the wrong reason. It is a device-pass item.

### DataModule Bindings

`DataModule.kt` defines a Koin `module { }` that binds repository interfaces to their implementations via `singleOf(::Impl) bind Interface::class` and provides the Room database, DAOs, and DataStore instances.

## Room TypeConverters

`Converters.kt` handles JSON serialization for complex Room fields: `List<String>`, `MessageContentPart` lists, `Feedback`, `FileReference` lists, etc. Uses the same `Json` instance from the Koin graph.

## Rules

- Dependencies: `:core:network`, `:core:model`, `:core:common`, Room, DataStore, security-crypto, Ktor, kotlinx-serialization, Timber, Koin.
- Convention plugins: `librechat.mobile.library` + `librechat.mobile.koin` + `librechat.mobile.room` + `librechat.kotlin.serialization`.
- Repositories must use `safeApiCall` from `:core:common` for all network calls. It carries the IO
  dispatcher hop as well as the error mapping (#326), so an API invocation reached any other way runs
  on whatever dispatcher the caller happened to launch from — the UI thread, for anything started
  from `viewModelScope`. **The invariant: every `:core:network` API-service invocation sits inside
  `safeApiCall`, inside `onApiDispatcher` (the same hop without the mapping, for calls that classify
  their own failures), or inside a flow that ends in `.flowOn(dispatcher)`.** The one HTTP call in
  this module that isn't an API-service method — `CommonTokenDataStore`'s token-refresh POST — is
  always driven from inside a request that already took the hop.
- Entities are internal to this module -- feature modules work with domain models from `:core:model`.
- All DAO read methods that the UI observes should return `Flow`, not suspend functions.

### New Repositories (Round 2)
- `MemoryRepository` / `MemoryRepositoryImpl` — wraps `MemoriesApi` for memory CRUD + preferences
- `McpRepository` / `McpRepositoryImpl` — wraps `McpApi` for server CRUD, tools, connection status, reinitialize
- Both bound in `DataModule.kt` via `singleOf`
- Both use `safeApiCall` — no local caching (server is sole source of truth for memories and MCP)
- **Gotcha**: Memory delete/update use `key` as identifier (not a separate ID field)
- **Gotcha**: MCP server operations use `serverName` as identifier

### New Repositories (Round 3)
- `BannerRepository` / `BannerRepositoryImpl` — wraps `BannerApi` for fetching server banners
- `AgentRepository.getAgentsPaginated()` — server-side paginated agent fetch, maps response to `PaginatedAgents` domain model
- Both bound in `DataModule.kt` via `singleOf`, both use `safeApiCall`, no local caching

### Per-server gateway headers (`servers` table)

`ServerRepository` / `ServerRepositoryImpl` own the gateway headers of issue #287 and are the
`ServerHeadersProvider` the HTTP clients read them through.

- **Device-scoped, no `accountId`.** Like `artifact_shortcuts`, deliberately absent from
  `AccountDataPurger` and from the detekt tenancy rule's table list: the headers are what let a user
  log back *in*, so logout must not take them.
- **Natural primary key.** `server_id` is the derived server id, not a surrogate — Room resolves
  `@Upsert` by primary key, so a surrogate would make every save after the first match zero rows and
  vanish silently. The whole-row `@Upsert` is safe *only* while the table has one non-key column and
  one writer; **any added per-server column (cert pinning, detected version, a label) has to make the
  writes column-scoped first.**
- **`headersFor` is non-suspend** — it is called inside `SwitchGate`'s lock and in the request
  pipeline's `State` phase. Persistence stays behind a `@Volatile` map guarded by `awaitWarm()`.
- **One seed read, then patch-on-write.** The repository is the table's only writer, so it keeps the
  map current by patching its own writes under the same lock. Observing the table instead hands those
  writes back a moment later, and a Room emission whose query snapshot predates a save can arrive
  after it, reverting a credential the user just typed.
- **Resolved `createdAtStart`.** The warm gate blocks the first HTTP request, so the database open it
  forces should overlap cold start rather than be serialized after it.
- **No migration — correct only while the release timeline holds.** An interim version kept these in
  the preference store under `srv:<serverId>:custom_headers`. No release tag contains it (verify with
  `git tag --contains <PR1 merge>`), so there is nothing on any device to move and no drain code.
  **This is a fact about the calendar, not a property of the code**: cut a release from `develop`
  between PR1 and this change and every user who configures headers on that build loses them silently
  on upgrade — no error, just a server they can no longer reach. If that ever happens, a drain is
  required after all. Otherwise don't add one back "for safety" — it would reintroduce a second writer
  and with it the patch-on-write race above.
- **A read failure is not "no headers".** `headersForServer` returns null when the store could not be
  read, and both editors render that as a warning instead of an empty list — an empty editor reads as
  "your credential is gone", and saving from it would make that true. Rules that keep the contract
  honest, each with a test: a row that won't decode is tracked per-server rather than skipped, as is
  one whose pairs all sanitize away (both otherwise report as "none configured"); a successful write
  does not clear the failure flag (a write proves one row is writable, not that the others were ever
  read); and the read is re-attempted after a failure (it is otherwise attempted once, so one
  transient error disables headers until the process is killed).
- **The empty-write refusal lives in `setHeaders`, not in the editors.** An empty map is a delete, and
  this repository is the only thing that knows whether the value it is about to destroy was ever
  successfully read — so it refuses that one combination itself and reports
  `HeaderWriteFailure.UnverifiedDelete`. Both editors write through it. Enforcing it caller-side means
  a copy of the rule in each editor, either of which can omit it. A **non-empty** write always goes
  through: re-entering the credential is the recovery path.
- **Two read paths, and the request path never retries.** `headersFor` / `awaitWarm` serve the request
  pipeline from a snapshot seeded once at startup; `headersForServer` serves the editors and reads
  through to the table every call. **Don't merge them.** No single retry policy serves both: bounded,
  one transient failure disables headers for the rest of the process; unbounded, an unreadable
  database queues every request behind the same failing query. Split, there is no policy to tune —
  opening an editor is what heals a store that failed at startup, and that is the moment a user is
  waiting for the answer anyway.
- **A write outranks a later failed read** (`writtenHere`). This class is the table's only writer, so
  a value it wrote is not in doubt even when the table stops reading. Without it a store whose reads
  fail but whose writes land confirms a save and then reports it unreadable, and the user re-enters a
  secret every request is already carrying.
- **Plaintext, deliberately.** The realistic exfiltration path for the app-private database is an ADB
  backup, which `android:allowBackup="false"` already closes; on iOS the app container is sandboxed.
  Against that, encrypting it would add the wipe-and-rebuild failure mode `TokenDataStore` has on OEMs
  with broken Keystores — and losing this particular value doesn't degrade to a re-login prompt, it
  degrades to a server the user can no longer reach at all.
- **The table is named for the deployment, not for the headers**, because per-server state with
  nowhere else to live (cert pinning, detected backend version, a user-chosen label) belongs here. It
  carries only the headers today; see the natural-primary-key bullet before adding a column.


### Fork schema numbering after September upstream merge

Keep this fork's v8 (message cacheTTL) and v9 (draft state_json) schema files intact.
Upstream independently used those numbers for server headers and prefetch watermarks;
those tables enter this fork together at v10. See `docs/SURPLUS_MCP_UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`.
