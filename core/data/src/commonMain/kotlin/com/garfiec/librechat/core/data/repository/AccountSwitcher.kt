/**
 * The single coordinator that switches the active account without re-login (issue #179). It owns the
 * *data-layer* transition — server URL, token key, roster pointer, published identity — sequenced
 * atomically under the [SwitchGate] barrier. It does **not** own session-scope teardown; that stays
 * reactive in `SessionManager`, driven by the identity flip this publishes.
 *
 * The switch is deliberately *lighter* than logout: it deletes **no** Room rows (retaining the other
 * account's data is the whole point) and re-keys **no** tokens ([TokenManager.selectAccount] is
 * non-destructive). It repoints identity/URL/token-key so the outgoing account's data + tokens stay at
 * rest for an instant switch back.
 *
 * **In-flight refresh safety:** an A-refresh already in flight when the switch runs is harmless —
 * the account-keyed, URL-pinned refresh path writes A's own slot and skips the active-cache
 * mutation once A is no longer active, so it can neither corrupt B nor stall the switch (the refresh
 * POST runs outside the token store's state lock). No refresh cancellation is needed or buildable.
 *
 * **Add-account** (signing in B while A stays live) is the second transition this owns, and it is
 * non-destructive toward A by construction: the flow's HTTP calls run under a [PendingRequestIdentity]
 * (B's URL + B's *staged* bearer — the global URL and A's identity are never touched), B's
 * freshly-issued tokens bare-stage (A's keyed slot untouched), and only the successful completion
 * flips URL/token/roster/identity to B atomically under the same [SwitchGate] barrier a switch uses.
 * At most one add is pending at a time (the auth screens drive exactly one flow); the pending state
 * lives in memory only, so a killed app self-cancels.
 *
 * **Remove-account** ([remove]) is the third owned transition: the destructive counterpart that
 * purges one account's roster entry, tokens, scoped preferences, and tenant rows — flipping the
 * active identity to a successor (or the logged-out state) first when the removed account was live.
