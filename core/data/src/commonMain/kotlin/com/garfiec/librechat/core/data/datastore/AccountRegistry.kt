/**
 * Owns the account **roster** cold-start seed and is the single [AccountReadyGate] every request /
 * route waits on. Persistence itself lives in [AccountRoster]; this class orchestrates the seed.
 *
 * There are three "active account" facts and they **cannot** be unified: the token store's
 * synchronously-seeded secure-storage mirror (the fast bearer path), the durable roster active pointer,
 * and the `serverId` derived from the persisted server URL. **The roster active pointer is the
 * authority**; the mirror is a bearer-seed cache. At cold start this seed reconciles them:
 *
 * 1. Read the persisted server URL (awaiting [ServerDataStore]'s own warm-up) — the migration input.
 * 2. One-time migrate the pre-roster single-active pointer into a one-entry roster ([AccountRoster.migrateIfNeeded]).
 * 3. Read the roster snapshot (authority).
 * 4. If an active entry exists: **drive** the server URL from it (enforcing the url↔account invariant
 *    even if the persisted URL drifted), reconcile the token mirror to it ([TokenManager.selectAccount],
 *    idempotent + non-destructive), then publish identity. If none: publish `Resolved(null)` and touch
 *    **no** tokens — an empty roster with tokens at rest is either a legacy pre-tenancy upgrade (bare
 *    tokens the restore safety net must claim, `restoreAccountIfNeeded`) or a crash mid-establish
 *    (keyed tokens the same safety net re-establishes); destroying them here would force a re-login.
 *
 * The publish uses the **low-level** [ActiveAccountProvider.set] / [ActiveAccountProvider.clear], never
 * [upsertActive] / [clearActiveAccount] — those await [seeded] and would self-deadlock this coroutine.
 * The whole body is inside the `try/finally` so [seeded] always completes and the [AccountReadyGate]
 * never hangs, even on an unexpected failure.
