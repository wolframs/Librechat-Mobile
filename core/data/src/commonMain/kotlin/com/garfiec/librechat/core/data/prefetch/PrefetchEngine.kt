/**
 * Warms the cache for the conversations the user is likeliest to open next, one request at a time,
 * only while [PrefetchGate] is open.
 *
 * A pass runs in four stages, and the order is load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Refresh the conversation list.** Freshness is decided by comparing each conversation's
 *    `updatedAt` against the watermark from its last warm — and that `updatedAt` is read from Room.
 *    Without syncing the list first the engine compares watermarks against the same stale timestamps
 *    it wrote them from, concludes nothing has changed, and never warms anything again. Skipped when
 *    a previous pass finished paging the list within the last few minutes — the one time-based rule
 *    in this feature, and it covers this stage only.
 * 2. **Warm messages** for whatever that reveals as stale.
 * 3. **Warm ancillary reference data** — endpoints, models, agents — once per account per process.
 * 4. **Prune** message rows for conversations that have aged out of the warm set.
