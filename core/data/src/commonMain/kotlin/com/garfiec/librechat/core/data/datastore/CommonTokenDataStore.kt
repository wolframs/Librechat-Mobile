/**
 * Account-keyed secure token store. Tokens are namespaced by account
 * (`acct:<accountId>:access_token`) and **several accounts' tokens are retained at rest at once** —
 * the foundation for switching accounts without re-login (multi-account, issue #179). A switch
 * ([selectAccount]) repoints the active binding to another already-keyed account without touching any
 * token slot; account removal ([removeAccount]) drops exactly one account's slot; and logout
 * ([onAccountCleared]) drops only the active account's slot.
 *
 * The active account is mirrored into the same synchronously-readable secure storage (key
 * [KEY_ACTIVE_ACCOUNT]) rather than the async account registry, so the bearer for the right account is
 * available without an async account lookup — the first-frame `isAuthenticated` check and the first
 * authed request never read a blind bearer at cold start. The mirror is loaded by [warmTokenCache] on
 * the IO dispatcher at startup, with [ensureTokenLoaded] as the synchronous fallback for whoever gets
 * there first. When no account is resolved (fresh install, logged out, or a legacy pre-keying upgrade)
 * the keys fall back to their bare form, which is also how tokens from an older build are read until
 * [onAccountResolved] re-homes them.
 *
 * **Authentication staging.** An interactive sign-in ([setTokens] from login/OAuth/2FA) always writes
 * the freshly-issued pair to the **bare** keys and drops the active binding, even when another account
 * is active. [onAccountResolved] then re-homes that staged pair into the resolved account's keyed
 * slot. This makes it structurally impossible for a re-login (e.g. a soft-expiry re-auth as a
 * different user) to overwrite the currently-active account's keyed tokens or leave its slot holding
 * another account's credentials. Steady-state token rotation does **not** go through [setTokens] —
 * refresh writes the keyed slot directly.
 *
 * **Locking.** [stateMutex] guards the in-memory identity/cache and short storage reads/writes of it;
 * it is held only for brief critical sections and **never across the refresh network POST**, so a
 * switch or logout never stalls behind a slow refresh. A per-account [flightMutex] serializes
 * refreshes of the *same* account across their POST (single-flight, so a second 401 reads the rotated
 * token instead of re-POSTing a spent one). [tokenEpochs] holds a per-slot epoch bumped by every
 * operation that invalidates THAT slot's token truth (logout, clear, removal, a new authentication,
 * an identity re-home); a refresh captures its slot's epoch before its POST and discards its result
 * if it changed, so a refresh that races a teardown can never resurrect the cleared session even
 * though the POST holds no lock — while another account's changes leave it valid.

     * Refresh [accountKey]'s tokens with a bounded retry loop, classifying the outcome so a caller can
     * tell a hard-expired session (route to re-auth) from a transient failure (keep the session).
     *
     * The whole loop runs under the per-account flight lock: same-account refreshes stay single-flight
     * across every retry+backoff, so a queued 401 waits and then reads the freshly-rotated token
     * instead of re-POSTing a spent one. [stateMutex] is still taken only for the brief epoch read and
     * the commit — never across a POST or a backoff delay — so a switch/logout never stalls behind a
     * slow or retrying refresh.
     *
     * A refresh 401 is **not** treated as immediately terminal: the backend returns the same `401`
     * ("Refresh token expired or not found") for a transiently-missed session (replica lag / lookup
     * hiccup) as for a genuinely-expired one, and the app relaunch that "fixes" such a logout proves
     * the token was fine — so an auth rejection is retried with backoff. The budget is classified
     * [HardExpired] if **any** attempt saw an auth rejection (a dead session must route to re-auth even
     * if a later attempt hit a transient blip); a purely transient run (5xx / rate-limit) stays
     * [Transient] so the session is kept. A transport failure (server unreachable) is terminal-Transient
     * rather than retried, so the flight lock is not held across repeated full request timeouts.
     *
     * A settled [HardExpired] also **drops the account's token slot** — see [settle].
     *
     * [usedAccessToken] collapses a queued burst: the flight lock serializes same-account refreshes but
     * does not *coalesce* them, so N callers each POST in turn. A waiter that arrives holding the bearer
     * its request sent can compare it against the slot once it gets the lock — if the value has already
     * moved, the holder before it rotated on its behalf and there is nothing left to do.
     *
     * [bestEffort] is the proactive-renewal mode ([ensureFreshAccessToken]) and changes two things:
     * a **single** attempt instead of the retry ladder, and **never** dropping the slot — any failure
     * returns [Transient]. Both follow from the same fact: a proactive renewal nobody is waiting on
     * must not be able to log the user out. The ladder exists because the backend answers `401`
     * identically for a dead session and a transiently-missed one, so a single attempt cannot tell
     * them apart — which is exactly why a single attempt must not be allowed to settle the question.
     * The request proceeds on its old bearer and the reactive 401 path, with its full ladder, keeps
     * sole ownership of the logout decision.
