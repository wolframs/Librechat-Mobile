/**
 * Account-keyed secure token store. Tokens are namespaced by account
 * (`acct:<accountId>:access_token`) and **several accounts' tokens are retained at rest at once** —
 * the foundation for switching accounts without re-login (multi-account, issue #179). A switch
 * ([selectAccount]) repoints the active binding to another already-keyed account without touching any
 * token slot; account removal ([removeAccount]) drops exactly one account's slot; and logout
 * ([onAccountCleared]) drops only the active account's slot.
 *
 * The active account is mirrored into the same secure storage (key
 * [KEY_ACTIVE_ACCOUNT]) rather than the async account registry, so the bearer for the right account
 * is seeded by [warmUp] behind the account-readiness gate — first routing and the first authenticated
 * request never read a blind bearer, while Android keystore setup stays off Main. When no account is
 * resolved (fresh install, logged out, or a legacy pre-keying upgrade) the keys fall back to their bare
 * form, which is also how tokens from an older build are read until [onAccountResolved] re-homes them.
 *
 * **Authentication staging.** An interactive sign-in ([setTokens] from login/OAuth/2FA) always writes
 * the freshly-issued pair to the **bare** keys and drops the active binding, even when another account
 * is active. [onAccountResolved] then re-homes that staged pair into the resolved account's keyed
 * slot. This makes it structurally impossible for a re-login (e.g. a soft-expiry re-auth as a
 * different user) to overwrite the currently-active account's keyed tokens or leave its slot holding
 * another account's credentials. Steady-state token rotation does **not** go through [setTokens] —
 * refresh writes the keyed slot directly.
 *
 * **Locking.** [stateMutex] guards the in-memory identity/cache and short storage reads/writes of it;
 * it is held only for brief critical sections and **never across the refresh network POST**, so a
 * switch or logout never stalls behind a slow refresh. A per-account [flightMutex] serializes
 * refreshes of the *same* account across their POST (single-flight, so a second 401 reads the rotated
 * token instead of re-POSTing a spent one). [tokenEpochs] holds a per-slot epoch bumped by every
 * operation that invalidates THAT slot's token truth (logout, clear, removal, a new authentication,
 * an identity re-home); a refresh captures its slot's epoch before its POST and discards its result
 * if it changed, so a refresh that races a teardown can never resurrect the cleared session even
 * though the POST holds no lock — while another account's changes leave it valid.
