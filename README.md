# Switchboard: LibreChat Mobile Client

[![LibreChat](https://img.shields.io/badge/LibreChat-v0.8.4_–_v0.8.8--rc1-blue)](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/releases/tag/v0.8.8-rc1)

A third-party native mobile client for [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/) (Android & iOS). Not affiliated with the official LibreChat project — this is an independent app that connects to any self-hosted LibreChat server, no backend modifications required.

> **Backend compatibility:** Tested against LibreChat **v0.8.4 – v0.8.8-rc1**. Older releases may work but are not guaranteed; newer releases are supported on a best-effort basis until the next sync.

## Why use this instead of the web app?

- **Smoother and faster** — a real native app instead of a website in a wrapper, so scrolling, typing, and watching responses stream in all feel snappier.
- **Feels like a mobile app, not a shrunk-down website** — familiar gestures like swipe to switch accounts and swipe back, comfortable tap targets, and a layout that adapts to tablets and foldables.
- **Plays nicely with your phone** — share text, images, and files into the app from anywhere *(Android)*, pin your favorite models or generated content to your home screen, open chat links straight into the right screen, and save or share images through your phone's normal menus.
- **Works without a connection** — your chat list and any conversations you've opened are saved on your phone, so you can keep reading with spotty or no signal.
- **Multiple accounts, one app** — sign in to different accounts on different LibreChat servers and switch between them instantly, no re-entering passwords.
- **Dictation stays on your phone** — voice typing runs on-device instead of through a server.

## Features

- **Multi-Account & Multi-Server** — Sign in to multiple accounts across different LibreChat servers and switch between them instantly, no re-login. Swipe the account chip to switch; storage is fully scoped per account.
- **Pin Artifacts to Home Screen** — Turn any generated artifact (HTML, React, SVG, Mermaid, Markdown) into a home-screen launcher icon that opens straight into a full-screen viewer — works on cold start, while logged out, and even after the source chat is deleted. *(Android)*
- **Quick Actions** — Your most-used models become home-screen shortcuts (Android) and long-press quick actions (iOS) that deep-link into a new chat with that model preselected.
- **Rich Media Viewer** — Full-screen, Google-Photos-style viewer with pinch-to-zoom and swipe between images across a branch or grid, shared by chat and files.
- **Native Upload, Share & Save** — Attach from the device or reuse existing server files without re-uploading, save images to your gallery, and share out through the system share sheet with original format preserved.
- **Themes** — Pick any accent color and the whole app regenerates a matching Material 3 palette — choose from presets or dial in a custom color (HSV or hex). System/light/dark modes, plus Material You wallpaper-based colors on Android 12+.
- **Chat** — Real-time streaming (SSE), message branching & sibling navigation, stop/regenerate/continue, markdown with syntax highlighting, LaTeX math rendering, code blocks with copy, image display, file attachments, tool call progress cards
- **Inline Artifacts** — Render Mermaid, SVG, HTML, React, and Markdown artifacts directly in chat messages at full message width with content-fit height. Per-type toggle in Settings → Chat → Artifacts.
- **Model Selection** — Searchable bottom sheet grouped by endpoint, model comparison mode
- **Agents** — Marketplace with search and categories, MCP server configuration
- **Conversations** — Paginated list with date grouping, tags, search, rename, archive, delete, share, fork, duplicate, export/import
- **Voice** — On-device live dictation (Android & iOS) with cloud fallback, plus text-to-speech playback
- **Mobile & Tablet** — Single adaptive UI: single-pane on phones, dual-pane layout (600dp+) with a persistent sidebar on tablets and foldables, with native predictive-back gestures
- **Settings** — In-app language switching, account management, data controls
- **Accessibility** — Semantic headings, content descriptions, 48dp touch targets, live regions

## Install (Android)

Pre-built, signed APKs are published on the [Releases](https://github.com/garfiec/Librechat-Mobile/releases) page. No need to build from source.

### Obtainium (recommended)

[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) installs the app straight from GitHub Releases and keeps it updated automatically.

[![Add to Obtainium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Add%20to-Obtainium-1e88e5?logo=android&logoColor=white)](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect.html?r=obtainium://add/https://github.com/garfiec/Librechat-Mobile)

1. Install Obtainium from its [releases](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases).
2. Tap the **Add to Obtainium** badge above (or, in Obtainium, *Add App* → paste `https://github.com/garfiec/Librechat-Mobile`).
3. Obtainium tracks new releases and prompts you to update when one ships.

Release-candidate builds (versions like `2026.07.1-rc1`) are published as GitHub *pre-releases* and are ignored unless you enable **Include prereleases** for the app in Obtainium.

### Manual install

Download the latest `switchboard-vYYYY.MM.P.apk` from [Releases](https://github.com/garfiec/Librechat-Mobile/releases) and open it on your device (you may need to allow installs from your browser/file manager).

### Verifying the signing key

All releases are signed with the same key, so updates install in place. Verify a downloaded APK matches the published certificate:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs switchboard-vYYYY.MM.P.apk
# or check the .sha256 checksum attached to each release:
sha256sum -c switchboard-vYYYY.MM.P.apk.sha256
```

> Signing certificate SHA-256: `66:8A:71:96:6A:07:06:14:D1:44:95:5D:83:E7:23:6A:3C:ED:77:F8:64:08:57:C3:FA:84:B0:3C:CD:E4:0E:59`

If the signing key ever changed, Android would refuse the update — so this key is permanent. Never install a build signed with a different certificate over an existing install.

### Verifying build provenance (optional, strongest)

Every release APK carries a [SLSA build-provenance attestation](https://github.com/garfiec/Librechat-Mobile/attestations), signed by GitHub Actions via Sigstore. Unlike the `.sha256` — which whoever attaches a release could regenerate — the attestation proves the binary was produced by this repo's release workflow at a specific commit, and **cannot be forged outside GitHub's CI**. With the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com):

```bash
gh attestation verify switchboard-vYYYY.MM.P.apk \
  --repo garfiec/Librechat-Mobile \
  --signer-workflow garfiec/Librechat-Mobile/.github/workflows/release.yml
```

A pass confirms the exact bytes you downloaded came from that workflow. The run and attestation are also linked from each release's notes — but those links are convenience, not proof; only the command above verifies the bytes in your hand.

## Server Setup

The app works with any standard LibreChat server. During onboarding, you'll enter your server URL (e.g., `https://chat.example.com` or `http://192.168.1.100:3080`).

### Required Configuration

Add the following to your LibreChat server's `.env` file:

```env
# Safety net for native app clients.
# The app sends a browser User-Agent to pass the uaParser middleware,
# but if it ever fails to parse, this prevents ban point accumulation.
NON_BROWSER_VIOLATION_SCORE=0
```

Without this setting, the server's violation system may accumulate ban points against the mobile client if the User-Agent check fails, eventually locking the account out.

### Notes

- **Registration** — The app respects your server's registration settings. If registration is disabled server-side, only the login form is shown.
- **Self-signed TLS certificates** — Both platforms enforce certificate requirements stricter than browsers, and Android additionally does not trust user-installed CAs by default. See [FAQ.md](FAQ.md#can-i-use-a-self-signed-tls-certificate) for details and workarounds.

## Requirements

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| JDK | 17+ |
| Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA | Latest stable (recommended IDE for all code editing) |
| Xcode | 15+ (iOS only, Apple Silicon Mac required — IDE not needed, CLI only) |
| iOS Deployment Target | 16.0+ |
| Gradle | 9.5.1 (via wrapper) |
| Kotlin | 2.4.10 |

## Building from Source

### Android

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

For a release build:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### iOS

Xcode builds the Kotlin framework itself via a build phase (direct integration), so there is no separate `link*Framework` step to run by hand.

**Simulator:**

```bash
xcodebuild -project iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj -scheme iosApp \
  -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
  -derivedDataPath iosApp/build build
```

**Physical device:**

```bash
open iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj
```

Then in Xcode: select your device, set your Team under Signing & Capabilities, and press ⌘R.

See [iosApp/README.md](iosApp/README.md) for full build and launch instructions.

### Tech Stack

- Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) with shared business logic
- Jetpack Compose (Android) + Compose Multiplatform (iOS)
- Koin (dependency injection)
- Ktor Client (OkHttp on Android, Darwin on iOS)
- Kotlinx Serialization
- Room (cache), DataStore (preferences), EncryptedSharedPreferences / Keychain (tokens)
- Kotlin 2.4.10, compileSdk 36, minSdk 26
