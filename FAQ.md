# FAQ

## Why not just add the web app to my home screen?

You can — LibreChat ships a PWA manifest with `display: standalone`, so an "Add to Home Screen" install gets you an icon and a chrome-less window. That covers the cosmetics. What it doesn't cover:

| | Web PWA | This app |
|---|---|---|
| **Receive shares from other apps** | No — the manifest declares no `share_target` | Text, images, arbitrary files, and multi-select, from any app *(Android)* |
| **Home-screen shortcuts** | One icon; the manifest declares no `shortcuts` | Per-model launcher shortcuts / quick actions on both platforms, plus artifacts pinned as their own icons *(Android)* |
| **Reading old chats offline** | No — the service worker precaches app assets, not conversation data | List and opened threads render from a local database |
| **Multiple accounts / servers at once** | One session per browser profile | Switch instantly; storage scoped per account |
| **On-device dictation** | Web Speech API is missing or vendor-hosted on mobile browsers | Platform on-device recognizers, with server STT as fallback |
| **System back gesture** | Navigates browser history | Navigates the app, with predictive-back previews |

## Can I use a self-signed TLS certificate?

Yes on iOS (with caveats). Not effectively on Android with the current release build — see below for workarounds.

Both platforms enforce TLS certificate requirements that ordinary browsers do not. A certificate that works in Chrome or Safari may still be rejected by the mobile app.

### Common requirements (iOS and Android)

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Subject Alternative Name** | DNS name must appear in the SAN extension. The CommonName fallback was removed in iOS 13 and in apps targeting Android 9+ (API 28). |
| **Signature algorithm** | SHA-256 or stronger. SHA-1 is rejected by iOS 13+ and by Android 10+ (API 29). |
| **Extended Key Usage** | The leaf certificate must include `id-kp-serverAuth` (TLS Web Server Authentication). Required by Apple for certs issued after July 1, 2019. |
| **Basic Constraints** | The issuing CA certificate must have `CA:TRUE`. |
| **Key size** | RSA ≥ 2048 bits, or any modern ECDSA curve (e.g. P-256). Much smaller keys may fail handshake via JSSE / Conscrypt algorithm constraints. |

[`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) generates certificates that meet all of the above automatically.

### iOS

iOS adds one platform-specific requirement on top of the table above:

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Validity period** | ≤ 825 days for the leaf certificate (Apple's cap for certs issued after July 1, 2019). |

> The widely-cited **398-day cap does not apply here** — that stricter limit only governs certificates chaining to the Root CAs that Apple preinstalls on the device. A CA you install and trust yourself is exempt from the 398-day rule, but the older 825-day cap still applies.

**Setup:**

1. Generate a compliant certificate signed by your own CA.
2. On your iPhone: **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management** — install your CA certificate.
3. Go to **Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings** — enable full trust for your CA.

Once the CA is trusted on the device, you only need to re-install it if you create a new CA. The server certificate itself (which you replace when it expires) does not need to be installed separately.

### Android

Android imposes no equivalent validity-period cap — multi-year self-signed certificates are accepted as long as the requirements in the common table above are met.

However, since Android 7.0 (API 24), apps trust **only the system CA store** by default. A CA that a user installs via **Settings → Security → Encryption & credentials → Install a certificate** is *not* trusted by apps unless the app explicitly opts in via its Network Security Config. **Switchboard does not currently opt in**, so a self-signed CA installed in device settings will not be trusted and the connection will fail with an `SSLHandshakeException` wrapping `CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found`.

If you need TLS with a self-hosted server on Android today, the practical options are:

- Use a publicly-trusted CA on a resolvable domain (Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL).
- Put the server behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel) that terminates TLS with a publicly-trusted certificate.
- Connect over plain HTTP on a trusted local network and accept the in-app warning. (Cleartext is permitted but TLS validation is **not** weakened — `cleartextTrafficPermitted="true"` only governs `http://`, not which roots are trusted for `https://`.)

> **Looking ahead:** Apps that target API 37+ (Android 17) get Certificate Transparency enabled by default for TLS connections. If user-CA opt-in is added later and the app's `targetSdk` reaches 37, self-signed leaf certs without SCTs will additionally need `<certificateTransparency enabled="false"/>` in the Network Security Config.
