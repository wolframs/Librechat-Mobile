# Releasing

How releases are versioned, signed, and published for Switchboard (Android & iOS).

## Versioning

The app version is calendar-based — **`YYYY.MM.PATCH`** (zero-padded month, e.g.
`2026.06.0`) — and lives in **one place**: `version.properties` at the repo root.

```properties
versionName=2026.06.0      # calver YYYY.MM.PATCH — bumped by the release workflow
backendTargetVersion=0.8.6 # LibreChat backend this build targets (best-tested)
```

- Year and month come from the current **UTC** date automatically when bumping; the only
  thing a release decides is patch-level vs release-candidate. PATCH resets to 0 when the
  month rolls over and increments for further releases within the same month.
- `AndroidApplicationConventionPlugin` reads `versionName` and **derives** `versionCode` as
  `YEAR*10000 + MONTH*100 + PATCH`: `2026.06.0` → `20260600`, `2026.06.1` → `20260601`.
  Monotonic as the date advances; limits are MONTH ≤ 99 (trivially true), PATCH ≤ 99.
- The About screen reads the *installed* version via `AppInfo` (package metadata), so it can never drift.
- This is the **app's** version and is intentionally independent of `backendTargetVersion`.
- `backendTargetVersion` is the **single source of truth** for the LibreChat backend the app
  targets. The app reads it via `BackendVersion.SUPPORTED_BACKEND_VERSION` (code-generated from
  this property by core/common's `generateBackendVersion` task), and `release.yml` reads the same
  key to add a **Target backend:** line to each release's notes. Edit the property — never the
  `SUPPORTED_BACKEND_VERSION` literal in `core/common/BackendVersion.kt` (it no longer exists as a literal).

Both platforms derive from the same `versionName`, so they stay in lockstep:

| Platform | versionName | versionCode | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android | `versionName` verbatim | derived YYYYMMPP | `AndroidApplicationConventionPlugin` reads `version.properties` at build |
| iOS | `CFBundleShortVersionString` | `CFBundleVersion` (same YYYYMMPP) | *Stamp Version* Xcode build phase reads `version.properties` at build |

> The "Stamp Version from version.properties" run-script phase runs after Info.plist is in
> the bundle and before codesign, so the committed `Info.plist` literals (and the unused
> `MARKETING_VERSION`/`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` build settings) are just a fallback snapshot —
> the build always reflects `version.properties`. The same stamp drives the published iOS IPA
> (see *Cutting a release* below), so both platforms' assets carry the identical calver.

Bump it with the script (also run by the release workflow). For example, running in
June 2026 with stored version `2026.05.2`:

```bash
scripts/bump-version.sh patch   # 2026.05.2 -> 2026.06.0  (new month: PATCH resets)
scripts/bump-version.sh patch   # 2026.06.0 -> 2026.06.1  (same month: PATCH+1)
```

### Release candidates

To ship a candidate before a stable release, use the pre-release bumps:

```bash
scripts/bump-version.sh prepatch  # 2026.06.1     -> 2026.06.2-rc1  (start a candidate)
scripts/bump-version.sh rc        # 2026.06.2-rc1 -> 2026.06.2-rc2  (next candidate)
scripts/bump-version.sh finalize  # 2026.06.2-rc2 -> 2026.06.2      (promote to stable)
```

`prepatch` starts a candidate for the next patch version; `rc` advances the candidate
number; `finalize` drops the suffix to promote the current candidate. `rc` and `finalize`
never touch the version core: a candidate started in June and finalized in July still
ships as `2026.06.x` — the date reflects when the release train started. A hyphenated
version is published as a GitHub **pre-release**, which Obtainium skips unless the user
enables *Include prereleases*.

> The `-rcN` suffix is stripped when deriving the versionCode, so `2026.06.2-rc1`,
> `2026.06.2-rc2`, and the final `2026.06.2` all share one versionCode. Candidates install
> over each other fine, but if users update *from* a candidate *to* the final build, bump
> the patch instead of finalizing so the version visibly advances.

### Calver cutover

Versions before the calver switch were semver (`0.1.0` – `0.1.3`) under the same
versionCode packing (`0.1.3` → `103`), so codes stayed monotonic across the cutover
(`103` → first calver release's `YYYYMM00`). The jump is intentionally one-way: calver
codes are ~20M, so there is no path back to small semver codes without an epoch scheme.

## One-time signing key setup

Releases must be signed with **one permanent key**. If the key ever changes, every existing
user's update fails with a signature conflict and recovery requires uninstall + reinstall
(full data loss). There is no key reset for direct/sideloaded distribution.

1. **Generate the keystore** (do this once, keep it forever):

   ```bash
   keytool -genkeypair -v \
     -keystore librechat-release.jks \
     -alias librechat \
     -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000 \
     -storetype PKCS12 \
     -dname "CN=LibreChat Mobile, O=LibreChat, C=US"
   ```

   > The `librechat` filename, alias, and dname above are historical — they record how the
   > existing release key was actually generated, before the app was renamed to Switchboard.
   > Do **not** "fix" them to match the new name: the dname is baked into the certificate, and
   > re-keying would make Android refuse the update for every existing install.

   Back it up in **2+ secure locations** (password manager / offline). Do **not** commit it
   (`.gitignore` already excludes `*.jks` and `keystore.properties`).

2. **Add GitHub repository secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions). Ideally put
   them in an Environment named `release` with required reviewers, so the release job is gated.

   | Secret | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `SIGNING_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `openssl base64 -A < librechat-release.jks` |
   | `SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD` | keystore password |
   | `SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD` | key password |
   | `SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS` | `librechat` |

3. **Publish the certificate fingerprint** in the README so users can verify:

   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore librechat-release.jks -alias librechat   # SHA-256 line
   ```

### Local signed builds (optional)

Create `keystore.properties` at the repo root (git-ignored):

```properties
storeFile=librechat-release.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=librechat
keyPassword=...
```

Then `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` produces a signed APK. Without env vars or this file,
release builds fall back to the debug key so local builds and CI checks still work.

## Cutting a release

1. Actions → **Release** → *Run workflow* → choose the bump (`patch` for a stable
   release, or `prepatch`/`rc`/`finalize` for the candidate flow). Year/month are
   derived from the current UTC date automatically.
2. The job bumps `version.properties`, builds a signed universal APK, signs a SLSA
   build-provenance attestation for it, and **only then** commits + tags `vYYYY.MM.P` and creates
   a **draft** GitHub Release with auto-generated notes and a `.sha256` checksum. Candidate
   versions are flagged as pre-releases automatically. If the build fails, nothing is committed
   or tagged — just re-run after fixing it.
3. A **secondary `ios` job** (macOS runner) then checks out the freshly tagged commit, builds
   an **unsigned device IPA**, attests it, and attaches `switchboard-vX.ipa` + `.sha256` to the
   same draft. It uses **no secrets and no Apple account** (sideload installers re-sign on the
   user's device), so it needs nothing beyond the standard CI setup. It is **non-blocking**: if
   the macOS build fails the Android tag + APK + draft already stand — re-run just the `ios` job
   or attach the IPA by hand. The IPA may land a few minutes after the APK.
4. Review the draft, edit the notes for users, then **publish**.
5. Obtainium / IzzyOnDroid pick up the published release automatically (Android); iOS users
   sideload the IPA manually (see *Installing the iOS IPA* below).

> **Drafts are invisible to Obtainium.** A release stays hidden from every user until you
> click **Publish** — Obtainium's GitHub source skips drafts. The workflow ends with a
> warning annotation reminding you to publish; don't skip it.

> **Branch protection:** the workflow pushes the version-bump commit and tag to the default
> branch, which is ruleset-protected. The `github-actions` bot can't be a ruleset bypass
> actor on a personal (non-org) repo, so the workflow authenticates the push with a
> fine-grained PAT instead. Create one (**Contents: read & write**, this repo only, short
> expiry) and add it as a secret named `RELEASE_PAT` in the `release` environment. It pushes
> as the repo owner (already a bypass actor); without it the run fails fast at the
> *Verify signing secrets* step.

## Installing the iOS IPA

The iOS asset (`switchboard-vX.ipa`) is **unsigned** — there is no Apple Developer account or
App Store path. iOS refuses to run unsigned code, so every install route below re-signs the
app on (or for) your device. Pick whichever your device supports:

- **AltStore / SideStore / Sideloadly** (any non-jailbroken iPhone). These re-sign the IPA
  with your **free Apple ID** on install. The free tier means a **7-day** signature that the
  app auto-refreshes while it can reach a desktop/Wi-Fi pairing (SideStore/AltStore do this in
  the background), and a limit of **3 sideloaded apps** at a time. No paid account needed.
- **TrollStore** (devices vulnerable to the CoreTrust bug — broadly iOS 14.0–16.6.1 and some
  17.0). Installs the unsigned IPA **permanently** (no 7-day refresh, no app limit) by
  fakesigning it on-device. The most convenient route if your device/iOS is in range.
- **Jailbroken devices** can install the IPA directly (e.g. `appinst`).

Because the IPA ships unsigned, the bundled signature is irrelevant — these tools all apply
their own. The build is provenance-attested all the same; verify the **download** the same way
as the APK (next section, swapping `.apk` for the `.ipa`).

> The app is a plain network client (no push, app groups, or associated domains), so it stays
> within free-Apple-ID entitlement limits — nothing extra to configure when sideloading.

## Verifying a release

Three checks are available to anyone who downloads an APK (or IPA), in descending order of strength:

1. **Build provenance (strongest)** — `gh attestation verify <apk> --repo garfiec/Librechat-Mobile
   --signer-workflow garfiec/Librechat-Mobile/.github/workflows/release.yml`. This is the only
   check that resists a *tampered upload*: it's signed by GitHub's CI via Sigstore and can't be
   forged outside the runner. Each release's notes link the run + attestation, but a link is not
   proof — only this command verifies the downloaded bytes. See the README install section. The
   **IPA is attested too** — run the same command with the `.ipa` in place of `<apk>`.
2. **Signing certificate** — `apksigner verify --print-certs <apk>`, compared against the
   published cert SHA-256. Catches a build signed with a different key. **APK only** — the IPA
   ships unsigned (the sideload installer applies its own signature), so there is no fixed iOS
   cert to pin; rely on provenance + checksum for the IPA.
3. **Checksum** — `sha256sum -c <apk>.sha256`. Catches accidental corruption or a download MITM
   only; it does *not* defend against a malicious release (the attacker would control both files).

## Distribution channels

- **Obtainium** — tracks GitHub Releases directly (see the README install section). Stable
  releases are full releases; `-rcN` candidate tags are marked pre-release.
- **IzzyOnDroid** (future) — ingests the developer-signed APK and pins the signing key via
  `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`. Use the *same* key. Reproducible builds earn a verification badge.
- **iOS sideloading** — the unsigned `.ipa` is attached to every GitHub Release for
  AltStore / SideStore / Sideloadly / TrollStore installs (see *Installing the iOS IPA*). There
  is no App Store or Obtainium-equivalent auto-update channel; users re-download on each release
  (a SideStore/AltStore source manifest is a possible future follow-up).
