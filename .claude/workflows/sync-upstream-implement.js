You are the implementer for a Switchboard upstream ${A.mode}. Repo root is CWD. Read the root
CLAUDE.md, ${A.skillDir}/reference/android-architecture.md, and each touched module's CLAUDE.md before editing.

Create the branch first:  git checkout -b ${A.branchName}   (off current HEAD).

CONVENTIONS (this project uses KOIN, not Hilt):
- safeApiCall for all repository network calls; UDF: UI -> ViewModel -> Repository -> API/Room.
- Koin DI: viewModelOf(::X)/singleOf(::X)/factoryOf(::X) in feature/*/di and core/*/di; koinViewModel() in
  Composables; register new modules in the shared Koin module list. Never hiltViewModel()/@HiltViewModel.
- @Serializable data classes in core/model; Ktor client patterns in core/network.
- KMP: for every touched module, update BOTH src/commonMain AND src/iosMain (and androidMain when relevant).
  expect in commonMain REQUIRES actual in every target. The approved items carry an iosMainCoverage flag —
  honor it.
- Apply the version gate exactly as each item specifies (isCompatibleOrNewer vs supportsFeature+landedDate).

APPROVED ITEMS (implement each; do not add unapproved scope):
${JSON.stringify(A.approvedItems)}

Commit per logical group with conventional-commit subjects (e.g. "feat(chat): render SUMMARY blocks").
Commit locally only.

HARD RULE: do NOT run git push, git push -u, or gh pr create. Ever. The branch stays local.

Report the full list of files created/modified grouped by module.`,

Version bookkeeping for the Switchboard ${A.targetMode} sync (base ${A.baseVersion},
target commit ${A.targetCommit}). Repo root is CWD. Do these IN ORDER:
1. Set backendTargetVersion in version.properties to the mode-correct form:
   release -> "${A.baseVersion}"   rc -> "${A.targetTag ? A.targetTag.replace(/^v/, '') : A.baseVersion}"
   partial -> "${A.baseVersion}+dev.${A.sha8}"
2. Advance the submodule:  cd upstream && git checkout ${A.targetCommit}   (detached HEAD).
3. Rewrite UPSTREAM_VERSION (keep its comment block):
     tag=${A.targetMode === 'partial' ? A.anchorTag : (A.targetTag || A.anchorTag)}
     commit=${A.targetCommit}
     date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
4. Update README.md compatibility badge + note upper bound (badge link target too):
   release/rc -> the tag; partial -> "${A.anchorTag} +dev" phrasing. Leave the lower bound.
5. Append to DISCOVERY.md: newly-discovered endpoints, removed endpoints, revised response shapes.
6. Update VERSION_GATES.md: a row per gated code path. For supportsFeature gates the row MUST cite the
   landing commit + landedDate (from the approved item) and the rc/final version at which the date can be
   dropped for a plain version gate.
